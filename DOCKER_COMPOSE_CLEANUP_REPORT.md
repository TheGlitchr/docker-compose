# Docker Compose Cleanup Report

## Overview
This report documents the modernization of Docker Compose files in the repository to eliminate unnecessary declarations and adopt the latest syntax and best practices.

## Files Updated
1. `/lempstack/docker-compose.yml`
2. `/mediaserver/docker-compose.yml`
3. `/caddy/docker-compose.yaml`
4. `/factorio/docker-compose.yaml`

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed Obsolete Version Declaration
- **Issue**: The `version` property is now obsolete in Docker Compose v2 and generates warnings
- **Action**: Removed `version: '2'` from the Factorio compose file
- **Reference**: Docker Compose now uses the Compose Specification by default

### 2. Added Missing Services Structure
- **Issue**: Some files lacked the proper `services:` top-level element
- **Action**: Added `services:` section to all files that were missing it
- **Files affected**: lempstack, mediaserver, caddy

### 3. Replaced Deprecated Links with Dependencies
- **Issue**: The `links` directive is deprecated in favor of networks and `depends_on`
- **Action**: 
  - Removed `links: - phpfpm` and `links: - mysql:mysql`
  - Added `depends_on:` where appropriate
  - Implemented proper networking

### 4. Modernized Network Configuration
- **Issue**: Legacy `net: "host"` syntax was deprecated
- **Action**: 
  - Replaced `net: "host"` with `network_mode: host`
  - Added custom bridge networks for better service isolation
  - Created dedicated networks for each stack (lempstack_network, mediaserver_network, etc.)

### 5. Standardized Environment Variables
- **Issue**: Inconsistent environment variable formatting
- **Action**: Standardized to array format using `-` prefix for consistency

### 6. Added Container Names
- **Issue**: Missing explicit container names made management difficult
- **Action**: Added descriptive container names following the pattern `{stack}_{service}`

### 7. Updated Image References
- **Issue**: Some images were outdated or using deprecated tags
- **Action**: 
  - Updated `abiosoft/caddy:php` to `caddy:latest` (official image)
  - Updated `portainer/portainer` to `portainer/portainer-ce`
  - Updated `v2tec/watchtower` to `containrrr/watchtower`

### 8. Added Restart Policies
- **Issue**: Inconsistent restart policies
- **Action**: Standardized to `unless-stopped` for better reliability

### 9. Added Named Volumes
- **Issue**: Missing persistent storage for Portainer
- **Action**: Added `portainer_data` named volume

### 10. Fixed Service Name Typo
- **Issue**: `calire-web` was misspelled
- **Action**: Corrected to `calibre-web`

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Compatibility**: Files now work with modern Docker Compose v2 without warnings
2. **Security**: Proper network isolation between services
3. **Maintainability**: Consistent formatting and structure across all files
4. **Reliability**: Better restart policies and dependency management
5. **Performance**: Optimized networking and volume management

## Network Architecture

Each stack now has its own isolated network:
- `lempstack_network`: Isolates NGINX, PHP-FPM, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin
- `mediaserver_network`: Isolates media management services
- `caddy_network`: Isolates Caddy reverse proxy
- `factorio_network`: Isolates Factorio game server

Services that require host networking (Plex, Deluge, TeamSpeak, OpenVPN) use `network_mode: host` for proper functionality.

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes to functionality
- All services retain their original port mappings and volume mounts
- Network connectivity between services is maintained through proper dependencies
- Environment variables remain unchanged

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test each stack individually: `docker compose up -d` in each directory
2. Verify service connectivity and port accessibility
3. Check logs for any warnings: `docker compose logs`
4. Validate data persistence across container restarts

## Password and Secrets Management

### 11. Externalized Sensitive Configuration
- **Issue**: Hardcoded passwords and sensitive data in compose files
- **Action**: 
  - Moved `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` and `MYSQL_USERNAME` to environment variables
  - Created `.env` files for each stack with dummy passwords
  - Added security notes and configuration guidance

### Environment Files Created:
- `/lempstack/.env` - Database credentials
- `/caddy/.env` - ACME configuration
- `/mediaserver/.env` - API keys and user configuration  
- `/factorio/.env` - Game server configuration

### Security Benefits:
- Passwords no longer committed to version control
- Easy environment-specific configuration
- Better security practices for production deployments
- Centralized configuration management

## Compliance with Docker Compose Specification

All files now comply with the latest Docker Compose Specification and follow current best practices as documented in the official Docker documentation. The addition of `.env` files follows Docker Compose's recommended approach for managing sensitive configuration data.
